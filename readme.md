## Description

The project was originally started by [Josh Balfour](https://github.com/joshbalfour/monstercat-connect-desktop-unofficial) but it used the old Connect client.

Monstercat has recently released what they call "Deon" and is a Connect client that anyone can use (even without a connect subscription!).

The desktop app ads features like media hotkey support. In the future, it will also support other cool things like push notifications (see roadmap).
